React is a library that is designed to update the browser DOM for us. We no longer
have to be concerned with the complexities associated with building performant SPAs
because React can do that for us. With React, we do not interact with the DOM API
directly. Instead, we interact with a virtual DOM, or set of instructions that React will
use to construct the UI and interact with the browser. 5

The virtual DOM is made up of React elements, which conceptually seem similar to
HTML elements, but are actually JavaScript objects. It is much faster to work directly
with JavaScript objects than it is to work with the DOM API. We make changes to a
JavaScript object, the virtual DOM, and React renders those changes for us using the
DOM API as efficiently as possible.
